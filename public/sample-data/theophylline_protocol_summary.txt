STUDY PROTOCOL SUMMARY
=======================

STUDY IDENTIFICATION
Study ID: THEO-PK-2024-001
Study Title: Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Study of Theophylline in Healthy Adult Subjects
Sponsor: PharmaCo Research Inc.
Test Facility: ABC Clinical Research Center
Test Facility Study Number: CRC-2024-0156

STUDY OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective:
To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of theophylline following a single intravenous dose administration in healthy adult subjects.

Secondary Objectives:
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of theophylline
- To determine key pharmacokinetic parameters including Cmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, and Vd

STUDY DESIGN
Type: Open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic study
Population: Healthy adult volunteers
Number of Subjects: 12 (6 male, 6 female)
Age Range: 18-55 years
BMI Range: 18.5-30.0 kg/m2

TEST ARTICLE
Name: Theophylline
Formulation: Solution for injection (25 mg/mL)
Dose: 320 mg (administered as 12.8 mL IV infusion over 20 minutes)
Route of Administration: Intravenous (IV)
Dosing Regimen: Single dose on Day 1

SAMPLING SCHEDULE
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected at the following timepoints:
- Pre-dose (0 h)
- 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-dose

Sample Volume: 4 mL whole blood per timepoint
Matrix: Plasma (EDTA)
Total Blood Volume: 36 mL per subject

BIOANALYTICAL METHOD
Analyte: Theophylline
Matrix: Human plasma
Method: Validated LC-MS/MS
LLOQ: 0.1 mg/L
Calibration Range: 0.1 - 20.0 mg/L

PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSIS
Software: Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.3)
Method: Non-compartmental analysis (NCA)
Parameters Calculated:
- Cmax: Maximum observed concentration
- Tmax: Time to maximum concentration
- AUClast: Area under the curve to last measurable concentration
- AUCinf: Area under the curve extrapolated to infinity
- t1/2: Terminal elimination half-life
- CL: Total body clearance
- Vz: Volume of distribution during terminal phase
