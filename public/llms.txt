> Pharmascribe is an AI-powered regulatory writing assistant that transforms pharmaceutical study data into FDA-compliant IND reports in minutes.

## Overview

Pharmascribe automates the creation of Investigational New Drug (IND) submission reports for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Built by pharmaceutical industry experts with extensive IND submission experience.

## Core Capabilities

- **Pharmacokinetics Reports**: Generate PK/TK reports from NCA parameters and concentration-time data
- **Multi-Report Support**: Toxicology, CMC, Clinical Pharmacology, Bioanalytical, ADME, Pharmacology
- **Protocol Extraction**: AI automatically extracts study metadata from PDF/Word protocols
- **Interactive Refinement**: Chat interface for iterative report improvement
- **Quality Control**: Automated regulatory compliance and data consistency checks
- **Export**: Publication-quality Microsoft Word (.docx) documents

## How It Works

1. Upload study data (CSV/Excel with NCA parameters, concentration data, figures)
2. Upload protocol document for automatic metadata extraction
3. AI generates complete regulatory-compliant report draft
4. Refine sections using natural language chat instructions
5. Run automated QC checks
6. Export final Word document

## Report Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| PK_REPORT | Pharmacokinetics/Toxicokinetics analysis |
| TOXICOLOGY | Toxicology study reports |
| CMC | Chemistry, Manufacturing & Controls |
| CLINICAL_PHARMACOLOGY | Clinical pharmacology studies |
| BIOANALYTICAL | Bioanalytical method validation |
| ADME | Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion |
